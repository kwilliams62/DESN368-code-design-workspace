            <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
            <ol class="instructions-list">
                <li>Scoop 13 one-teaspoon size balls of Biscoff cookie butter onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and place into the freezer to freeze.</li>
                <li>Place butter and ½ cup of Biscoff cookie butter in a medium bowl and mix together until smooth. Add both sugars and mix again until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and mix in.</li>
                <li>Add salt, baking soda and flour to the bowl and mix on low, being careful not to over mix. Stop mixing when you still have flour remnants around the bowl.</li>
                <li>Scoop the dough into large balls using a 3 tablespoon cookie scoop. Take the frozen cookie butter balls out of the freezer. Push cookie butter balls into the cookie dough, making sure to completely cover with cookie dough.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough into balls. Place 6-7 cookies on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake the cookies at 350°F for 11-13 minutes, or until golden brown along the edge. Melt 2 tablespoons of cookie butter in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. Drizzle on baked cookies and sprinkle with some flaked salt. Allow to cool and set.</li>

                <p class="chef-secret">🍪 Chef's Secret: These cookies are pure magic!</p>
                <p>These are also great <strong>without</strong> the cookie butter center if you just want a simple Biscoff flavored cookie. If your cookies don't come out in a perfect circle, run a spoon or spatula around the rim right out of the oven to help shape them.</p>
                <p>I have given both cups and grams as measurements. Grams will be more <strong>precise</strong>, especially when measuring flour. If you don't have a kitchen scale, no problem! Just lightly spoon flour into your measuring cup to ensure it's not packed in there. <strong>Light</strong> and <strong>fluffy</strong> is the key.</p>
