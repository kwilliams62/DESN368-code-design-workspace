# DESN368 - Web Design 1 Portfolio

## About This Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in Web Design 1 (DESN368) during Fall Quarter 2025. Here you'll find my projects, experiments, and exercises as I learn HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of web design.

## Course Overview

- **Instructor:** Travis Masingale
- **Institution:** Eastern Washington University
- **Term:** Fall Quarter 2025

## Week 1 - Introduction to the Internet and the Web

**Topics Covered:**
- What is the Internet vs. the World Wide Web
- How browsers work
- Understanding IP addresses, DNS, and URLs
- History of the web

**Key Takeaways:**
The internet involves many computers moving bits of data using various methods, like cables and wireless signals. This information transfer is managed by key protocols and systems like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, which can be secured using SSL/TLS to encrypt the data.

## Week 2 - Intro to Semantic HTML

**Topics Covered:**
- Semantic HTML
- Codedex.io Strucutre
- Web Design Evolution
- Figma

**Key Takeaways:**
The key to building a webpage is using semantic HTML to define the content's meaning rather than just its visual appearance, which is crucial for accessibility through features like image alt text and form labels. After building the page with core elements, it's essential to use tools like an HTML validator and the DOM inspector to find errors and ensure the code behaves as expected.

**Projects/Exercises:**
- Figma logo and icon
- Migrated Projects
- Codedex.io exercises

## Week 3 - Intro to CSS

**Topics Covered:**
- Intro to CSS
- What is CSS

**Key Takeaways:**
CSS is the language used to style HTML webpages by targeting elements with selectors and applying declarations for properties like color and font size. The browser determines which style to apply through the "cascade," a system that prioritizes rules based on their specificity (e.g., IDs are more powerful than classes), inheritance, and their order in the CSS file.

**Projects/Exercises:**
- CSS foundations
- Recipe in style
- Figma tribute
- Figma app screens
- Codecademy
- Semantics challenge

## Week 4 - Repository Organization & Documentation

**Topics Covered:**
- Repository organization
- Writing effective documentation
- Markdown formatting

**Key Takeaways:**
Effectively styling a webpage requires using CSS to control fundamental text, link, and list appearances, utilizing properties like font-family and managing default list margins. For enhanced design and accessibility, links must be styled through all five pseudo-class states in the correct order, and custom web fonts can be implemented using the @font-face rule or online services.

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✓ Organized repo with week folders
- ✓ Archived original README
- ✓ Created new portfolio-style README
