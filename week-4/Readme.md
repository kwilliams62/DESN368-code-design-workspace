## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
One challenging part was the fact that I designed at a much bigger scale in Figma, so when translating it to code, I had to go in and adjust my font size and width to better suit the website. Another challenge I had was the two-column grid systems, which I tried to figure out but ultimately ended up having to ask Copilot for help. I also had a small issue with my images not loading and had to go in and rename image files, create new folders, and rewrite my code so that they would show up.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
After getting to practice, I understand containers and timelines a lot better now, as I included a lot of containers, and my timeline was a little more complicated than just a list. 

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
I think it does match my design pretty close, but I think in the future I would keep in mind that when designing it, it has to be translated to code, so I need to keep it within my scope of knowledge. I feel as though there were a lot of elements I designed and didn't know how to translate, so I was having to look up a lot of things and ask Copilot for help.
