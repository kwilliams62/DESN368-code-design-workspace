                    Marsha P. Johnson was a <span class="highlight">pioneering transgender activist</span>, 
                    Stonewall veteran, and drag performer who fought tirelessly for LGBTQ+ rights and 
                    the most marginalized members of her community. Her warmth, courage, and 
                    unwavering dedication to justice made her a beloved figure and an icon of resistance.

                    <h3>A Revolutionary Spirit</h3>
                    <p>
                        Born Malcolm Michaels Jr. in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Marsha arrived in 
                        New York City with $15 and a bag of clothes. She quickly became a prominent 
                        figure in Greenwich Village, known for her joyful spirit, elaborate outfits, 
                        and her commitment to helping those in need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "P" in her name stood for "Pay It No Mind," her response to questions 
                        about her gender. This phrase became a philosophy of resilience and 
                        self-acceptance that continues to inspire activists today.

                            moment in LGBTQ+ history. Her participation in this watershed event
