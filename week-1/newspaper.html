<h2>DreamWorks Forecasts Loss and Its Stock Plunges</h2>
<h3>July 11, 2005</h3> 
<br>
<p>DreamWorks Animation faced a financial setback due to weaker-than-expected DVD sales of Shrek 2, causing its stock to drop 5.3% to $23.27 and fall 20% since its IPO. The company revised its second-quarter forecast from breaking even to a loss of 7 to 9 cents per share, and lowered its full-year earnings estimate to 80 to 90 cents per share, down from $1 to $1.25. CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg attributed the decline to poor DVD performance and increased competition from other films.</p>
