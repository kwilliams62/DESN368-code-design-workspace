        <p>"But if you bought me a car now, it would be yours when I go away to school in two years. Still practically new,” Helen said optimistically. Unfortunately, her father was no sucker.
“Lennie, just because the state of Massachusetts thinks it’s okay for sixteen-year-olds to drive . . .” Jerry began.
“Almost seventeen,” Helen reminded.
“Doesn’t mean that I have to agree with it.” He was winning, but Helen hadn’t lost yet.
“You know, the Pig only has another year or two left in her,” Helen said, referring to the ancient Jeep Wrangler her father drove, which she suspected might have been parked outside the castle where the Magna Carta was signed. “And think of all the gas money we could save if we got a hybrid, or even went full electric. Wave of the future, Dad.”</p>

        <p>
“Uh-huh” was all he’d say.
Now she’d lost.
Helen Hamilton groaned softly to herself and looked out over the railing of the ferry that was bringing her back to Nantucket. She contemplated another year of riding her bike to school in November and, when the snow got too deep, scrounging for rides or, worst of all, taking the bus. She shivered in anticipated agony and tried not to think about it. Some of the Labor Day tourists were staring at her, not unusual, so Helen tried to turn her face away as subtly as she could. When Helen looked in a mirror all she saw were the basics—two eyes, a nose, and a mouth—but strangers from off island tended to stare, which was really annoying.</p>

        <p>Luckily for Helen, most of the tourists on the ferry that afternoon were there for the view, not her portrait. They were so determined to cram in a little scenic beauty before the end of summer that they felt obliged to ooh and aah at every marvel of the Atlantic Ocean, though it was all lost on Helen. As far as she was concerned, growing up on a tiny island was nothing but a pain, and she couldn’t wait to go to college off island, off Massachusetts, and off the entire eastern seaboard if she could manage it.
It wasn’t that Helen hated her home life. In fact, she and her father got along perfectly. Her mom had ditched them both when Helen was a baby, but Jerry had learned early on how to give his daughter just the right amount of attention. He didn’t hover, yet he was always there for her when she needed him. Buried under a thin layer of resentment about the current car situation, she knew she could never ask for a better dad.</p>

        <h2>Why I Chose This Book and These Fonts</h2>
        
        <p> I selected Starcrossed because it beautifully merges Greek mythology with contemporary young adult fiction. The story of forbidden love across ancient bloodlines deserves a presentation that feels both timeless and elegant—much like the myths that inspire it.</p>

        <p> For the title and sub-headings I chose greek inspired fonts as the book is based on greek mythology, and for the body I used a simple serif font because serif fonts are traditional for book reading and provide good readability for long-form text.</p>
